#Harmony Chain HHack the Horizion.

Thank you Harmony and Hack the Horizon! https://gitcoin.co/issue/harmony-one/hackathon/1/100024063

This is my entry for the Hackathon. I had started on porting the Augur protocol to harmony, but I decided with about a week to go I wasn't going to get it over the
line.
The Stake Trading project was actually fun, it required a crazy amount of project management and creativity to produce something I could work with for
my demonstration. 
When's the next one? :)
